## Overview

This tool was created to speed up the packaging process of Win32 applications within Intune.  
As some of you may have noticed, Adobe hasn't made it easy to deploy Acrobat applications as Win32 apps in Microsoft Intune.  
The purpose of this repository was to simplify the deployment of Adobe Reader applications in Intune.
